# DKAL
### Docker and Kubernetes on ARM and Linux

This repo contains the slides for my presentation and the  files necessary to follow the steps outlined in the [wiki](https://github.com/k4k/DKAL/wiki).

## Purpose
See if a Pi cluster consisting of a Pi2 controller node and four Pi0 worker nodes could run a full Kubernetes cluster. I wanted to have a small, self contained, Kubernetes cluster I could take with me for experimentation and novelty. There was no practical application intended. I did it just because I could.
